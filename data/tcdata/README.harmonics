The tide and current harmonic data contained herein are derived from the corresponding XTIDE harmonic data.
The file data have been tweaked to work nicely in the US, especially fixing current direction reporting.
We have also added additional global tide stations, and corrected calculation/display units where sensible.
A generic XTIDE harmonic file set will be functional, but less useful than the harmonic data packaged with OpenCPN.
