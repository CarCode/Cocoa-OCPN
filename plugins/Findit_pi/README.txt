FindIt for OpenCPN
==========================

It's a stowage-manager.

Building from source
--------------------
Clone the git repository to <OPENCPN_SOURCE_TLD>/plugins/findit_pi (the _pi at the end matters!)
cd <OPENCPN_SOURCE_TLD>/plugins
git clone git://github.com/konnibe/FindIt_pi.git findit_pi

Build OpenCPN as normally (build instructions on http://opencpn.org)
