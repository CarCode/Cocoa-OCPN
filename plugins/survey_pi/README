Survey plugin for OpenCPN
=========================

Uses the excellent Spatialite library from http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/
To browse and organize your data, get https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gui/index and/or https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gis/index

On Windows you need iconv.dll somewhere in your PATH or in OpenCPN's program directory. Get it from https://github.com/downloads/nohal/survey_pi/iconv.dll

To compile on Windows you need iconv - The easiest to get it is to use OSGeo4W - described a bit more in the note bellow.

Note
====

If, in the future, we will want to get all the functionality from spatialite

Compilation on Linux
sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev libproj-dev libfreexl-dev

Compilation on Windows:
Get OSGeo4Win: http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/
Install the following libraries: proj.4, freexl, geos, iconv
If you don't like the default location C:\OSGeo4W, you will have to modify CMakeLists.txt

Usage on Windows
Copy the following DLLs to the OpenCPN program folder: freexl.dll, geos_c.dll, proj.dll, iconv.dll - They can be found in the bin subfolder of your OSGeo4W instalation
