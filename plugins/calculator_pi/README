Calculator Plugin for OpenCPN by SaltyPaws aka Walbert Schulpen
=======================================

This is a light weight yet powerful calculator plugin for OpenCPN.  Would you like to know your hull speed?

Key features are:
* Storing results in variables
* Shows historic calculations
* Full scientific functions
* Screen footprint can be optimised & minimised as required

Help
=========
Type help in the calculator to get these instructions.

Examples of expression that work in the calculator are: (comments are in brackets, some results depend on other example calculations):
=========
Hull speed:
	LWL=48			(water line lenght in feet)
	vhull=1.34*LWL^(1/2)	(hull speed in knots)

Conversions:
	ftm=0.3048			(feet to meters)
	km_to_nm=0.539957		(Kilometers to nautical Mile)
	ftm*LWL			(waterline length in meters)

Distance to horizon
	R=6378.1*1000		(Radius of the earth in m)
	H=2.5			(Height of the eye above sea-level in m)
	d = R * acos(R/(R + h))	(Distance to horizon in m)   
	ans*km_to_nm		(Distance to horizon in nm)

Distance to lighthouse
	H1=200			(height of lighthouse in m)
	d1 = R*acos(R/(R + H1))	(Distance to horizon in m)
	distance=d1+d		(visibility range of lighthouse in m)

Operators:
	+ - * / ^ (NB use ^(1/2) for square root)         
	% & | << >> = <> < > <= >= ||
	! (Factorial)
 
Functions:
	Abs, Exp, Sign, Sqrt, Log, Log10
	Sin, Cos, Tan, ASin, ACos, Atan (default entry is in radians use e.g. sin(dtr*90) to calculate in degree)
	Factorial
 
Variables:
	Pi, e
	Ans is the result of the previous calulation
	dtr is the conversion factor from degrees to radians		
	you can define your own variables (e.g. myvariable=10/8*cos(dtr*90) or yourvariable=Ans)
	clear removes results in the history, but leaves your defined variables in tact

User Interface - type these commands in the command window:
	history - Toggle the history panel
	showhelp - Show/Hide the Help button
	showcalculate - Show/Hide the Calculate button
	showhistory - Show/Hide the history toggle
	help - show the help menu

Settings/Plugins/Preferences:
	Show/Hide Calculate, Help and History toggle buttons
	History Settings: max Results - History will be cleared after this many results have been stored to save memory. Max 30000.
	Show history window: Show/Hide default state
	Capture when hidden: disable capturing of history when history panel is hidden - this will save some memory
	Log to opencpn: Enable/Disable logging of results to opencpn logfile.
 
Other:
	Scientific notation supported
	Error handling supported


Compiling
=========
You have to be able to compile OpenCPN itself - Get the info at http://opencpn.org/ocpn/developers_manual

* go to the plugin subdirectory in your OpenCPN source tree
* git clone https://github.com/SaltyPaws/calculator_pi.git

Build as normally:

* cd ..
* cd build
* cmake ../
* make
* sudo make install
