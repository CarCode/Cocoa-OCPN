# JavaScript plugin for OpenCPN

This plugin for OpenCPN allows you to run JavaScript and to interact with OpenCPN.  You can use it to script your own enhancements to standard OpenCPN functionality.

The functionality in OpenCPN that can be scripted depends on the APIs built into the plugin.  These will be expanded as the need arises.  [A user guide is available here.](https://github.com/antipole2/JavaScript_pi/blob/master/documentation/JavaScript%20plugin%20user%20guide.pdf)

This version has been tested running under MacOS, Windows and Linux.


Building is documented in INSTALL.md

The plugin uses a continous integration setup described in the
[wiki](https://github.com/Rasbats/managed_plugins/wiki/Alternative-Workflow)
This setup is also able to push all updated metadata files to a clone
of https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins in order to simplify pull requests
against this site.
